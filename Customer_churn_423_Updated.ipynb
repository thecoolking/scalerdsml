        "- **Transactional Data:** Includes all customer transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and payments. This data often resides in transaction processing systems.\n",
        "- **Customer Interaction Data:** Information from CRM systems, including customer service interactions, feedback, and complaints.\n",
        "- **Account Information:** Details about the type and number of products each customer holds, account opening date, and account status.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### External Sources:\n",
        "- **Credit Scores:** Often obtained from credit bureaus or external credit scoring agencies.\n",

        "### 2. Data Collection Mechanisms\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Manual Data Entry:\n",
        "- **Forms and Applications:** Data entered by customers on applications or forms, either online or in paper form, needs to be digitized and integrated into the bank’s data systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Data Ingestion\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Batch Processing:\n",
        "- **Scheduled Imports:** Data from systems like CRM or external databases is imported at regular intervals (e.g., nightly, weekly).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Real-Time Processing:\n",
        "- **Streaming Data:** Transactional data might be streamed in real-time for immediate analysis, such as detecting fraud or high-value transactions that could indicate a risk of churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Data Verification and Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Consistency Checks:** Ensure data across different sources is consistent, e.g., the same customer is identified similarly across all datasets.\n",
        "- **Accuracy Checks:** Validate that data like credit scores or personal information is accurately recorded and reflects the true state of affairs."

        "The Medallion Architecture, also known as the Data Mesh, consists of three layers that structure data processing and storage in a way that optimizes for scalability, accessibility, and reliability. Here's how these layers can be utilized for your dataset in the context of churn prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data Layer)\n",
        "- **Purpose:** This layer stores raw data as it is ingested from various sources. For churn prediction, this includes all the raw customer data collected by the bank.\n",
        "- **Data Science Usage:** Data scientists use this layer for initial data exploration and quality checks. They can assess the completeness and accuracy of the raw data, including identifying any missing values or anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Silver Layer (Cleansed Data Layer)\n",
        "- **Purpose:** Data in this layer is cleansed, transformed, and enriched to make it ready for analysis. This involves preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.\n",
        "- **Data Science Usage:** The cleansed and processed data in this layer is used for more detailed analysis and model training. Data scientists can start building predictive models using this refined data, optimizing features to better predict customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Gold Layer (Aggregated Data Layer)\n",
        "- **Purpose:** This layer contains highly aggregated and summarized data. For churn prediction, it could include customer segments identified as high risk, summary statistics like average churn rate by demographic, or the results of predictive models.\n",
        "- **Data Science Usage:** Data scientists and business analysts use this layer for generating insights, reporting, and decision-making. It is also where predictive insights are operationalized, allowing for strategic actions like targeted customer retention campaigns."
